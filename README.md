## Building 

You need to install packer before.

### VirtualBox

Run:
```
./virtualbox.sh
```


This step will build the base VM as an OVA without install gns3 on it.

If you want to install GNS3 you need to unzip the OVA and run:
```
./release_virtualbox.sh 1.4.0 GNS3\ VM.ova
```

### VMware

Run:
```
./vmware.sh
```

For exporting to OVA you need to install:
https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL400&productId=353

If you want to install GNS3 you need to unzip the OVA and run:
```
./release_vmware.sh 1.4.0 GNS3\ VM.ova
```

#### Upload to ESXi
